///   - Buy side: processor input shortfalls from the economy report, plus any
///     explicit player buy orders (max-price limited).
/// Orders are sorted by price priority (cheapest seller first, highest bidder
/// first) with corp id as the deterministic tiebreaker. Matching proceeds buyer-
/// first: each buyer draws from the cheapest compatible seller; a preferred_seller
/// hint wins ties and is matched when up to 10% more expensive than the cheapest
/// alternative. Clearing price per match = seller's floor price (ask). Volume-
/// weighted average price of all matches drives the EMA price update. Unmatched
/// surplus/shortfall still updates mc.supply/demand for the UI. Pools are debited
/// only for matched sell quantities.
