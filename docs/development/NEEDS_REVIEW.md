# Project Io — Needs Review

**Ben's review queue.** Readable mirror of [`NEEDS_REVIEW.json`](NEEDS_REVIEW.json),
which is canonical — the JSON wins on any disagreement.

> **Generated file.** Produced by `node tools/session/render_needs_review.js`.
> Edit the JSON, then re-run; hand edits here are overwritten.

Things here are waiting on **your judgement**, not on work. Three kinds:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **question** | An open call nobody has made. Not blocking — a blocking item is a backlog entry with `blocked_on` set. |
| **decision-taken** | A call made **on your behalf** so work could continue. Recorded so it can be *overturned* rather than quietly becoming precedent. |
| **observation** | Something noticed in passing, too small or too cross-cutting to file, that a human should still see. |

**How this differs from the neighbours.** [`review.json`](review.json) is a *blocker* list —
items blocked on a visual artifact only you can produce; work there cannot proceed at all.
[`backlog.json`](backlog.json) is *work*. Entries here are neither: they are questions and
reversible calls. If an answer creates work, file a backlog item and resolve the entry with
that item's id.

This queue is **transient**: resolved entries are pruned promptly rather than kept for
posterity — the reasoning lands in code, an authority doc, or a backlog item at the moment
the work happens, and that is the durable record. What stays here is what is still open.

*2 entries — 2 open, 0 resolved.*

## Open

### NR-164 — Re-stress generation and time-lapse feel when playable
*question · raised 2026-08-11 · from 2026-08-11 notes session with Ben.*

Ben wants to re-stress-test world generation and the staged-generation time-lapse once the game is playable, to judge whether it feels alive rather than just correct. RULING 2026-08-13 (Ben, elicitation form): keep open until playable - not scheduled, not folded into another item.

### NR-237 — BL-286 added eleven resource_type values the Lua loader could not parse, and nothing noticed for eleven days
*observation · raised 2026-08-15 · from BL-429's ancient chain — the first authored recipe to reference a BL-286 good.*

recipe_registry.cpp's resource_from_name table claims in its own comment to cover 'the full enum so recipes outside the prototype subset load without a retrofit'. It did not: grain, fodder, salt, transport_capacity, charcoal, iron_blooms, bullion and trade_goods_misc were all missing, so ANY recipe naming one threw 'Unknown resource' at load. Added them while landing BL-429.

**Why it matters.** The defect was invisible because it needed an authored recipe to trigger it, and BL-286 deliberately shipped enum + serialisation + base-price wiring with the behaviours 'unfiled' — so nothing consumed the new goods and nothing exercised the parse path. The failure mode is the one this project keeps meeting from a different direction: a data layer that is only ever validated by the data currently authored against it. Note the loader DID behave correctly once reached (it threw and named the value); the gap was that nothing reached it.

> **Recommendation:** No action needed on the fix itself — it landed with BL-429. The question worth your call is whether BL-432's roster harness should assert the parse map covers resource_count, which would catch the next such gap at the moment the enum grows rather than whenever someone first authors against it. Cheap, and it is the same shape as BL-432's existing 'no orphan resources' row.

## Resolved

Kept, not pruned: the reasoning is the point. Prune only in a deliberate sweep, once the
answer has landed in an authority doc.
