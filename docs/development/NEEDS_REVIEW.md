# Project Io — Needs Review

**Ben's review queue.** Readable mirror of [`NEEDS_REVIEW.json`](NEEDS_REVIEW.json),
which is canonical — the JSON wins on any disagreement.

> **Generated file.** Produced by `node tools/session/render_needs_review.js`.
> Edit the JSON, then re-run; hand edits here are overwritten.

Things here are waiting on **your judgement**, not on work. Three kinds:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **question** | An open call nobody has made. Not blocking — a blocking item is a backlog entry with `blocked_on` set. |
| **decision-taken** | A call made **on your behalf** so work could continue. Recorded so it can be *overturned* rather than quietly becoming precedent. |
| **observation** | Something noticed in passing, too small or too cross-cutting to file, that a human should still see. |

**How this differs from the neighbours.** [`review.json`](review.json) is a *blocker* list —
items blocked on a visual artifact only you can produce; work there cannot proceed at all.
[`backlog.json`](backlog.json) is *work*. Entries here are neither: they are questions and
reversible calls. If an answer creates work, file a backlog item and resolve the entry with
that item's id.

This queue is **transient**: resolved entries are pruned promptly rather than kept for
posterity — the reasoning lands in code, an authority doc, or a backlog item at the moment
the work happens, and that is the durable record. What stays here is what is still open.

*2 entries — 2 open, 0 resolved.*

## Open

### NR-800 — BL-814 carried a phase-6 restructure, and it was deleted with the budget chain
*decision taken on your behalf · raised 2026-09-08 · from Re-authoring sprint 35 around generation visibility, on your ruling "drop it - a watched wait needs no budget".*

BL-813, BL-814 and BL-815 were deleted outright under the 2026-08-24 unstarted-plans policy. BL-812 (phase 6 sees roads) was kept, as it is not part of that chain.

**Why it matters.** BL-814 was filed as a startup-time item but its actual content was a PHASE 6 restructure: retire the warm start so phase 6 becomes the only judge of the position play opens on, and it named a specific known blocker - generate_corporations appends and runs before the registry loads, so phase 6 cannot vary the specialist roster at the live seam. That blocker is a fact about the code, not about the budget, and it will still be true when phase 6 is picked back up. The ruling was about the budget; deleting the restructure with it is my reading of it, not yours.

- Leave it deleted - the substance is recorded in the sprint 35 risk note and can be re-filed from there.
- Re-file the restructure as its own item, under phase 6 rather than under startup time.

> **Recommendation:** Leave it deleted for now. Phase 6 has no search built at all (BL-770 was cancelled with the board clear), so the restructure has nothing to serve yet; re-file it when phase 6 is next picked up.

### NR-807 — CONCEPT.md still names the ancient arc as the live product, and the epoch moved to 1960
*question · raised 2026-09-09 · from The doc-contradiction sweep at the close of sprint 35.*

CONCEPT.md line 74 says: the live product is the ancient arc, the campaign epoch is 0 CE, the player a mercenary company. Your 2026-09-08 calendar makes the epoch 1960, and era_band_for_epoch flips to industrial at 1700 - so generation now runs the INDUSTRIAL arc.

**Why it matters.** I fixed the generation-side citation because the calendar is that doc subject. I did NOT touch this one, because it is not a date - it names WHO THE PLAYER IS and which product is live. Changing the live arc from ancient to industrial in the doc that owns player identity is a product call, not a reconciliation, and CONCEPT.md is the authority the rest of the corpus reads for it.

- The live product is now the industrial arc; CONCEPT.md is updated and the mercenary-company framing revisited with it.
- The ancient arc stays the live product and 1560-1960 is generation own arc for this work, with both supported.
- The epoch move was about generation calendar only and CONCEPT.md is correct as written.

> **Recommendation:** The second, provisionally - both arcs already exist in the code (era_band_for_epoch branches on the epoch, and HISTORY.md was already written arc-aware), so nothing forces a product choice yet. But it should be YOUR sentence, not mine, and it is the kind of thing that quietly becomes true by being left alone.

## Resolved

Kept, not pruned: the reasoning is the point. Prune only in a deliberate sweep, once the
answer has landed in an authority doc.
