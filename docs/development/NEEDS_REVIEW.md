# Project Io — Needs Review

**Ben's review queue.** Readable mirror of [`NEEDS_REVIEW.json`](NEEDS_REVIEW.json),
which is canonical — the JSON wins on any disagreement.

> **Generated file.** Produced by `node tools/session/render_needs_review.js`.
> Edit the JSON, then re-run; hand edits here are overwritten.

Things here are waiting on **your judgement**, not on work. Three kinds:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **question** | An open call nobody has made. Not blocking — a blocking item is a backlog entry with `blocked_on` set. |
| **decision-taken** | A call made **on your behalf** so work could continue. Recorded so it can be *overturned* rather than quietly becoming precedent. |
| **observation** | Something noticed in passing, too small or too cross-cutting to file, that a human should still see. |

**How this differs from the neighbours.** [`review.json`](review.json) is a *blocker* list —
items blocked on a visual artifact only you can produce; work there cannot proceed at all.
[`backlog.json`](backlog.json) is *work*. Entries here are neither: they are questions and
reversible calls. If an answer creates work, file a backlog item and resolve the entry with
that item's id.

This queue is **transient**: resolved entries are pruned promptly rather than kept for
posterity — the reasoning lands in code, an authority doc, or a backlog item at the moment
the work happens, and that is the durable record. What stays here is what is still open.

*0 entries — 0 open, 0 resolved.*

## Open

*Nothing open.*

## Resolved

Kept, not pruned: the reasoning is the point. Prune only in a deliberate sweep, once the
answer has landed in an authority doc.
