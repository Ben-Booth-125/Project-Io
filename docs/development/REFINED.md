# Project Io — REFINED (active worklist)

The **active, prioritised, actionable worklist** (formerly TASKS.md). Unlike the backlog
([`backlog.json`](backlog.json) metadata + [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) design bodies), every
entry here is a concrete, file-scoped, individually-buildable step ready to execute. Tasks are
**promoted** from a `designed` (`✓`) backlog item (see [`DELIVERY.md`](DELIVERY.md)) and cleared
as they complete — this file is transient and is expected to be empty between work blocks.

> **Proportionality (see DELIVERY.md § Proportionality, and Rule 0).** Promoting an item into
> this file is for *substantial* (Full-mode) work. A quick low-risk high-value change — a
> one-file fix, an obvious cleanup, a cheap optimisation — does **not** need a task group or a
> REQUIREMENTS table: make and verify it directly, then commit. Reach for the full lifecycle
> only where its coordination cost pays back; applying it to trivial work is over-engineering.

## Task format

List tasks in **execution order**, grouped by the item they were promoted
from. Each task carries:

- **A group-scoped ID letter** (A, B, C, …), so dependencies and parallel pairs
  can be named.
- **A difficulty** in brackets (the backlog 1–5 time scale; tasks carry difficulty
  only — priority is a backlog-level triage concept, not a per-task field).
- **A one-line action** — imperative; what to change.
- **File scope** — the files the task is expected to touch. This is what makes
  collisions between tasks visible.
- **Dependencies** — which sibling tasks must land first (or "foundation" /
  "independent root").
- **Parallelisation** — whether it can run concurrently with a sibling, and
  whether as a sub-agent. Only true when the file scopes are **disjoint**.

End each group with a **parallelisation note**: the dependency shape and which
roots are safe to fan out. Concurrent sub-agents run in **separate git worktrees**
(the isolation mechanism); the collision map is a *splitting heuristic* for carving
focused agents, not a hard disjointness gate. Agents build and commit on their own
worktree branch; the integrating session merges, builds, and verifies. See
[`DELIVERY.md`](DELIVERY.md) § Sub-agents & worktrees for the authoritative model.

### Template

```
## <Group name> (promoted from BACKLOG § <item>)

Requirements: requirements.json § <slug>

- **[<difficulty>] A — <action>.** Files: `<paths>`. Deps: foundation. Satisfies: R1, R2.
- **[<difficulty>] B — <action>.** Files: `<paths>`. Deps: A. Parallel-safe with C. Satisfies: R3.
- **[<difficulty>] C — <action>.** Files: `<paths>`. Deps: A. Parallel-safe with B. Satisfies: R4.

Parallelisation note: A → {B, C}; B ∥ C (disjoint files). Promote D once B and C
land; D depends on both.
```

Requirement records (the data + permanent history) live in
[`req/requirements.json`](req/requirements.json); the schema and workflow policy are in
[`req/REQUIREMENTS.md`](req/REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Definition of "complete"

A task is **complete** only when, for **every** requirement it satisfies, all three
of the following hold — completeness is measured against the requirements, not
against "the code is written":

- **Reviewed** — the change has been read back against each requirement it claims to
  satisfy, for correctness and for project conventions (naming, comments,
  determinism).
- **Implemented** — the change exists and the affected target builds clean.
- **Tested** — each requirement's **Verification** has actually been *run* and
  passed, not merely assumed. A requirement whose verification has no available
  skill or tool follows the verification-method policy in
  [`req/REQUIREMENTS.md`](req/REQUIREMENTS.md) (§ Verifying when no skill or tool
  exists) — until its method is run (or explicitly deferred and the requirement
  left `pending`), the task is **not** complete.

A task that is implemented and builds but whose requirements have not all been
reviewed and tested is *code-complete*, not complete. Only mark a group cleared
(and its item removed) when its requirements are complete by this definition,
or its remaining rows are explicitly accepted as out of scope. See also
[`../GLOSSARY.md`](../GLOSSARY.md) **Complete (task state)**.

## Cancelling a task group

REFINED.md is a **working state**: a group is meant to be driven to *complete* (see
above) in **one working block**. A group that cannot be — blocked, out of time, or
superseded — is **cancelled** rather than left half-tracked. Cancelling a group:

1. **Marks its requirements `failed`** in [`req/requirements.json`](req/requirements.json)
   (with the reason in `notes`), so the failed attempt is on record. Rows genuinely met
   before the block stalled keep their real status. The group `status` is then flipped to
   `"cancelled"` with a `resolution` recording the cancellation — the record is never
   deleted. Re-promoting flips it back to `"active"`.
2. **Rewrites the group's task intent back into the backlog** (a new or existing item in
   [`backlog.json`](backlog.json) / [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)) as described intent, **merging
   into a related existing item** where one exists rather than duplicating.
3. **Removes the task stubs** (the A–F entries) from this file.

Cancelling reverts *tracking*, not committed code — code already landed stays in the
tree; its intent simply returns to the backlog to be re-promoted later. A group is
thus always in one of two terminal states: **completed**, or **cancelled** back to
the backlog. See also [`../GLOSSARY.md`](../GLOSSARY.md) **Cancelled (task state)**.

## Pausing a task group (deliberate handoff)

Driving a group to *complete* in one block is the default, **not** a mandate (see CLAUDE.md
§ Proportionality and session boundaries). When ending a session early serves the work — the
batch is large, context is drifting, or a natural checkpoint is reached — **pause** the group
rather than force completion or cancel it. A paused group is a deliberate scoping choice,
distinct from a *cancelled* one (which reverts intent to the backlog): the tasks stay in this file,
ready for the next session to resume.

Pausing is only legitimate if the stop is **clean and resumable**:

1. **REFINED.md is true to state** — completed tasks marked done, the in-flight task marked as
   the resume point, untouched tasks left as-is. No silent half-edits.
2. **The build is green, or the breakage is noted** — if the tree does not build, say exactly
   why and what the next session must finish to green it.
3. **A one-line handoff** records where to resume ("resume here: D — wire the panel into
   `app.cpp`; B/C landed and verified").

A paused group is therefore *not* a terminal state — it is an explicit, recorded intermission.
The barrier semantics for a multi-item set still hold *within* a session; pausing is how a
session boundary is drawn *between* them.

## Dividing work across agents & authoring tasks

This is the method used to promote an item and (optionally) fan it out to
parallel sub-agents. It is descriptive of how the v0.0.3 Environment groups were
run; follow it when promoting future work.

> **Note (2026-06-16):** the **authoritative** sub-agent model is now
> [`DELIVERY.md`](DELIVERY.md) § Sub-agents & worktrees — **worktrees are the primary isolation
> mechanism** and agents build/commit on their own branch. The decomposition and
> file-mapping guidance below still holds (it is how you carve focused agents); where this
> section's older "disjoint write-sets / sub-agents don't commit" phrasing conflicts with the
> worktree model, DELIVERY.md wins.

### 1. Decompose, then map every task to its files

Break the intent into the **smallest independently-buildable steps**, foundation
first. For each step, write down the **exact files it will write** — not roughly,
literally. This file list is the single most important field: it is what makes
collisions visible and is the input to every parallelisation decision below. A
task whose file scope you cannot name yet is not ready to promote; it needs more
design first.

Build the **collision map** before deciding anything about agents: list each file
and the tasks that touch it. Hotspot files (touched by many tasks) and shared
headers/data-model files are where parallelism dies — see them early.

### 2. The rule for what can run concurrently

Two tasks may run as **concurrent agents only if their file write-sets are
disjoint.** No exceptions — two agents writing the same file race and corrupt
each other's edits. Consequences that follow directly from this rule:

- **Passes inside one generator do not parallelise.** This codebase keeps all
  passes of a generator in one `.cpp` (e.g. `tile_generation.cpp` holds six
  passes). They share a file, so they are sequential. Do **not** split a file
  into per-pass translation units just to win parallelism — fighting the
  codebase's structure costs more than it saves. Concurrency lives **across**
  groups, not within a generator.
- **Compile/data dependencies gate whole groups.** If group B reads a type or
  data that group A produces (corporations need the nation component to exist and
  nations to be populated), B cannot start until A has landed — regardless of
  whether their files happen to be disjoint.
- **Prefer whole-pipeline-per-agent over pass-per-agent.** When a group's passes
  share a file, give the *whole group* to one agent that works sequentially
  inside it, rather than trying to slice it.

### 3. Adjust the design to *create* disjointness (cheaply)

Small, principled data-model choices can turn a collision into two disjoint
scopes. Example from v0.0.3: storing tile→nation ownership in a `world` map
(`tile_to_nation`) instead of adding a field to `tile_component` kept the nation
group off `tile_generation.{hpp,cpp}`, so it could run concurrently with the tile
tuning group. Make these moves when they are also *good design*; never contort the
model purely for parallelism.

### 4. Keep hotspot files and integration in the main session

The file every group eventually touches (here, `hard_coded_world.cpp` — the
campaign wiring) is **never given to a sub-agent.** The integrating (main) session
owns it, wires each group's entry point as that group lands, runs the build, and
verifies. **Sub-agents do not build or commit** — they write code on a disjoint
scope and report their public signature + the one-line hook the integrator should
add. This keeps the one shared file single-writer and makes integration a small,
deliberate step rather than a merge.

### 5. Author a task so a cold agent can execute it

A sub-agent starts with **no memory of the planning conversation.** A task handed
to one must therefore carry, in its own text: the authoritative design doc to
read, the exact file scope (and an explicit "do not touch X" for the hotspots),
the project conventions (naming, comments, determinism), the entry-point/signature
to expose, the "do not build/commit" instruction, and the report-back shape.
Known footguns belong in the prompt too (e.g. the member-name-shadows-enum-type
qualification trap). If the task can't be executed from its text alone, it is
under-specified.

### 6. Run order

Group concurrent agents into **waves** of disjoint scopes; run dependent groups in
later waves. After each wave the integrator wires hooks, **builds, and verifies**
(headless harness for pure `world/*` logic per `reference_headless_build`; a full
`cmake` build to confirm the real target still links) before starting the next
wave. Verify retroactively — do not assume an agent's self-reported success.

## Cross-platform build — Linux + Windows (promoted from BACKLOG § BL-057) — **COMPLETE**

Closed 2026-07-04 by reconciliation: the promoted tasks were left non-terminal although the work
verifiably shipped. Font portability (bundled DejaVuSans), the native Linux build (GCC-14 /
sol2 v3.5.0 fixes), the Actions CI matrix (Linux g++-13/g++-14 + Windows MSVC — first run green
on all three jobs), and the Xvfb/software-renderer offscreen spike all landed and verified.
Permanent record: DEVLOG 2026-06-29 (first native Linux GUI build),
`req/requirements.json § cross-platform-build`, TECH_FOUNDATIONS § Building. **Residue (recorded
per the cancelling policy):** the golden re-bless under the software renderer is deferred —
`scripts/verify/bless_all.sh` exists; once re-blessed goldens land, the advisory `visual-verify`
CI job drops `continue-on-error` and becomes a hard gate. Summary retained one cycle
(from 2026-07-04).

---

## v0.0.8 Batch Delivery — Legibility pass + commercial-sphere fog (promoted 2026-07-04) — **COMPLETE**

All six items landed 2026-07-04, one commit each: BL-088 persistent trade routes (`57e8b7b`),
BL-083 population-centre markers (`ae64ed1`), BL-085 player presence (`370a0a7`), BL-084
industry-density lens (`1619b13`), BL-086 ambient opportunity read (`6878160`), BL-089
commercial-sphere fog (`af07ad0`); batch close `d3629a2`; v0.0.8 cut `8540878`. Verified by the
`trade_routes` + `commercial_fog` headless harnesses and blessed visual goldens. Permanent
record: DEVLOG 2026-07-04, `req/requirements.json`, `docs/ui/DISCOVERY.md`. Summary retained
one cycle (from 2026-07-04).

---

## v0.0.9 Batch Delivery — polish pass (delivered 2026-07-05) — **COMPLETE**

Five promote-ready polish items delivered in one batch, per-item commits: **BL-070** in-app system
menu (gear popup — Pause/Resume + Exit-with-confirm, Esc parity), **BL-081** economy-ledger
legibility (widened balances + dropped per-building table + un-cramped sibling Workforce/Pools/
Markets tables), **BL-082** construction panel height-capped clear of the bottom-left Selection
element during placement, **BL-090** corp-emblem glyph family (shared `ui::icons::corp_emblem` +
`palette::corp_emblem_shape`/`corp_identity_colour`, rendered for player + rivals on card /
selection header / on-canvas markers / hover), and **BL-089 deferral 1 of 2** (hover-card body
activity line). Sub-agents ran the three disjoint UI slices (BL-081, BL-090, BL-089-hover); the two
`app.cpp`-touching items (BL-070, BL-082) stayed in the main session; one integrating build.
Verified by the new `scripts/verify/v009_batch.lua` (4 Windows-blessed goldens) + build-clean;
interaction/hover-gated surfaces (BL-070 popup interior, BL-089 tooltip) code-verified.
**Deferred (recorded, not dropped):** the BL-089 proximity-glimpse peek (save-seam/determinism cost
disproportionate to a polish minor — re-assess at the v0.1.0 boundary). Permanent record: DEVLOG
2026-07-05, `req/requirements.json`, backlog resolutions, `docs/ui/{MENU,LAYOUT,SELECTION,ICONS,
DISCOVERY}.md`. Summary retained one cycle (from 2026-07-05).
