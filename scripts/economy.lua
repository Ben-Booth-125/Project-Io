-- Project Io — economy.lua
-- Per-building-type economic constants and the global production thresholds for
-- the Layer 3 economy. Loaded at startup into the C++ recipe registry
-- (see src/world/recipe_registry.{hpp,cpp}).
--
-- Magnitudes are legible round defaults, iterated by playtest, not derived
-- (PRODUCTION.md / RESOURCES.md). They are deliberately easy to read in the
-- economy panel: a staffed mine moves ore in tens per tick, refined goods sell
-- for several times their inputs.

economy = {
    -- Two-threshold partial-run model for processing buildings, expressed as a
    -- fraction of a full run's input need that the corp pool must cover:
    --   pool coverage >= t_full          -> run full from the pool (self-sufficient)
    --   t_idle <= coverage < t_full      -> run full, auto-buying the shortfall
    --   coverage < t_idle                -> idle
    thresholds = {
        t_full = 1.0,
        t_idle = 0.2,
    },

    -- Per building_type constants.
    --   base_rate   — extraction: output units per tick at richness 1, workforce 1.
    --                 processing: recipe batches per tick at workforce 1.
    --   maintenance — flat per-tick upkeep charged to the owning corp.
    --   base_wage   — wage per unit workforce per tick (wage = workforce * base_wage).
    --   build_cost  — one-off construction cost (used by the Layer 4 build UI).
    --   build_duration_ticks — economy ticks the building spends under
    --                 construction before it produces anything (0 = instant).
    -- MATERIAL COSTS: re-enabled 2026-07-06 (BL-095-lite). BL-044 originally gated
    -- these against the corp's own pool on the body (construction.cpp), which
    -- deadlocked a fresh start — a corp's steel surplus auto-sells each tick
    -- (market_clearing.cpp), so the pool never held enough to build. Construction
    -- now buys the material cost from the tile's local MARKET at its prevailing
    -- price, folded into the credit debit — the resource line is what the cash
    -- buys, not a pool gate. A depletable market stockpile (the fuller BL-095
    -- gate/charge model) is still open; this is the quick, playable interim.
    -- BUILD DURATION added 2026-07-06 (playtest patch): a headless spree check
    -- found the player could place a dozen-plus buildings in one instant burst
    -- with zero ticks elapsed — construction had no time cost at all, letting
    -- the small chartered-company layer outpace the automated population/
    -- substrate economy it's supposed to sit on top of (GENERATION_STRATEGY.md).
