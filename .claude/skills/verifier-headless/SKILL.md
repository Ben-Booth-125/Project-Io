description: Run a Project Io headless logic-verification harness. Compiles and runs a tools/verify/<name>.cpp harness over the SDL/Lua-free world/* logic and reports its PASS/FAIL assertions. Use to verify pure simulation/generation logic (economy arithmetic, tile generation, placement audits) without launching the GUI. Authorising a new check = adding a tools/verify/*.cpp harness and naming it here.

# verifier-headless

Compiles and runs a headless C++ harness over the `world/*` logic and reports its
assertions. The `world/*` translation units depend only on the standard library
(no SDL / ImGui / Lua), so a harness links without the GUI stack — the fast path
for verifying pure simulation and generation logic. Counterpart to
`verifier-visual` (which covers the rendered `visual` class). Design context:
`docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_PRACTICES.md` § Testing; memory `reference-headless-build`.

## Argument

The harness to run, as a `tools/verify/<name>.cpp` path or just its name
(e.g. `econ_harness`, `world_audit`). If omitted, list the harnesses in
`tools/verify/` (each `*.cpp`) and ask which to run. Exact build/run commands are
in `tools/verify/README.md`.

## Available harnesses

- **`econ_harness`** — Layer 3 economy arithmetic (production → market clearing →
  budget) against a hand-built world + registry. Links `world.cpp`,
  `economy_system.cpp`, `market_clearing.cpp`, `budget_system.cpp`.
- **`econ_stability`** — runs the economy loop (production → market clearing →
  budget) over 100 ticks on a small fixed world and asserts multi-tick stability:
  prices stay in the `[0.25×, 4×]` band, no NaN/Inf, deposit reserves decrease
  monotonically, balances stay bounded. Links the same TUs as `econ_harness`
  (`world.cpp`, `economy_system.cpp`, `market_clearing.cpp`, `budget_system.cpp`).
- **`world_audit`** — builds the hard-coded world and audits Kepler biome balance
  (forest + wetland fraction), extraction-asset placement, deposit-reserve seeding,
  and the reusable `placement_rules::can_place` seam (placed assets pass it; ocean /
  zero-deposit tiles are rejected). Links the generation TUs (`tile_generation`,
  `nation_generation`, `corporation_generation`, `population_generation`,
  `placement_rules`, `hard_coded_world`, `orbital_system`, `world`).
- **`construction_harness`** — Layer 4 player construction (`construct_building`):
  `placement_rules::can_place` validation, build-cost spend from the corp balance,
  building/stockpile authoring and asset attachment, default-recipe seeding, and the
  insufficient-funds / unknown-corp / unknown-tile guards. Links `world.cpp`,
  `construction.cpp`, `placement_rules.cpp` (hand-builds a `recipe_registry`).

## Procedure

1. **Compile** from the repo root, after sourcing the VS BuildTools `vcvars64`
   (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat`),
   with the harness's own source list (see `tools/verify/README.md`), e.g.:
   ```
   cl /nologo /std:c++20 /EHsc /I src tools\verify\econ_harness.cpp ^
      src\world\world.cpp src\world\economy_system.cpp ^
      src\world\market_clearing.cpp src\world\budget_system.cpp /Fe:econ_harness.exe
   ```
   Keep harnesses **outside `src/`** — CMake `GLOB_RECURSE`s `src/*.cpp` into the
   real build.
2. **Run** the produced exe. From PowerShell a bare name fails (`9009`) when cwd
   isn't on PATH — invoke as `& ".\econ_harness.exe"` or with an absolute path.
   Each harness prints `PASS` / `FAIL` lines and exits non-zero on any failure.
3. **Report** the assertion results against the requirement being checked; cite the
   harness name and the failing lines if any.

## Notes

- Deterministic: the harnesses build a fixed world (hand-authored or
  `make_hard_coded_world`), so results are reproducible.
- Keep `recipe_registry.hpp` **pure data** (sol2 only in its `.cpp`) so economy
  logic stays harness-buildable; a harness hand-builds a `recipe_registry` rather
  than loading Lua. The Lua-loading + GUI path is covered by `verifier-visual`.
- To author a new check: add `tools/verify/<name>.cpp` with `check(...)`-style
  assertions, record its build line in `tools/verify/README.md`, name it under
  **Available harnesses** above, then run it through this skill — that is how a
  check becomes a permanent, reusable asset.
